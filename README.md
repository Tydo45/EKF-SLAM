# EKF-SLAM

Authors: Benjamin Weber, Danial Ruppin

## Project Structure
A brief, single-sentence description of each file or folder in the project. I should know the purpose of each file or folder from looking at the README.


## Setup
Install the required python libraries by installing the requirements file:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

## Use
The simulation can be run and visualized by running main.py:
```
$ python main.py
```
This will run the simulation and save the simulation history as ```output/slam_history.jsonl```  

The visualizer is then run on the saved simulation history and will open a window to display the simulation. 

## Output Format
